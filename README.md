# BabyUSDT - Passive income paid in USDT with Self-Custody.

With their tokenomics, each Buy/Sell is taxed, and then that tax is distributed automatically back to holders' wallets in the form of the native coin.

Our tokenomics work very similarly but with a twist. Instead of receiving the native coin, the tax is converted into tether and then automatically distributed to community members who hold Baby USDT. The more you hold, the more reflections you get.

The distribution is volume-based, and when the smart contract is satisfied, it will automatically send tether to your wallet. Due to the need to satisfy the smart contract, the distribution period varies.
